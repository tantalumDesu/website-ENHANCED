<div class="mucho">DnD Economy Spreadsheet</div>
<div class="boring">This spreadsheet is a DnD 3.5 edition tool for populating the available cash and inventory of a fantasy economic zone; taking into account the local wealth, the physical inventory size, the item rarity, and population density of the given area.<br>Unfortunately, the limitations of Google Docs prevents me from sharing the full functionality, as far as I understand.<br>Also included on tabbed sheets are tools for blacksmiths' services, magical item shops, procedurally-generated jewellery, tavern services, town/city services, and a list of material components and their costs for all Player's Handbook spells that require them.<br><br>While this was designed for use with DnD version 3.5, the General Stores, Blacksmiths, Jewellery, Taverns and Services sheets are all compatible with 5e.</div>
